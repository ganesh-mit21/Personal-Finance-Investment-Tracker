Personal Finance & Investment Tracker
Phase 1:
Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Requirement Gathering
A centralized system is needed to manage income, expenses, and investments together in one place.

Users want automatic calculations of savings, monthly budgets, and return on investments (ROI).
The system should provide alerts and reminders when:
Expenses exceed the planned budget.
Investments reach maturity or SIPs are due.
Users require reports and dashboards to analyze spending patterns, savings growth, and portfolio performance.
The solution must be simple, scalable, and user-friendly, so that individuals can adopt it for long-term financial planning.
 Stakeholder Analysis
Primary Stakeholders:
Individual users (students, professionals, families) who want to track their financial activities.
Secondary Stakeholders:
Financial Advisors â€“ who can use insights from the system to guide clients.
Family Members â€“ who can co-manage shared expenses or joint investments.

ðŸ”¹ Business Process Mapping
User logs income sources (salary, bonus, side hustles).
User records expenses under categories (food, travel, shopping, rent, bills).
The system auto-calculates savings = income â€“ expenses.
User adds investments (stocks, mutual funds, FDs, SIPs).
The system calculates returns (ROI) and tracks portfolio growth.
Alerts and reminders are generated for overspending or upcoming due dates.
Users view dashboards and reports for overall financial health and decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
Personal Finance Industry: Increasing number of individuals are adopting digital tools to manage finances and investments.
Market Gap:
Apps like ET Money, Groww, MoneyControl exist but they are standalone apps with limited customization.
Salesforce provides flexibility, automation, and powerful reporting features that can make this solution more personalized.
Use Case:
A professional can log salary and expenses, track investments, and get automated insights on whether theyâ€™re meeting financial goals like education fund, travel, or emergency savings.

ðŸ”¹ AppExchange Exploration

Expense/Budget Apps â†’ Focus mainly on corporate or departmental budgeting.
Investment Management Apps â†’ Built for large enterprises and financial institutions.
Gap Identified:
Lack of a personalized, individual-level finance management tool.
Opportunity:
This project will act as a lightweight, customizable solution for individuals to track income, expenses, and investments while benefiting from Salesforce automation and dashboards.
