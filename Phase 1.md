# 📊 Salesforce Business Finance & Investment Tracker  

## Problem Statement  
Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) face **fragmented financial management**. Income, expenses, invoices, and investment data are spread across spreadsheets, accounting tools, and bank portals. This leads to:

- Poor tracking of **company investments and ROI**  
- Lack of **forecasting for expansion or compliance**  

**Goal:** Build a Salesforce-based **Business Finance & Investment Tracker** that centralizes all financial data, enables automation, and provides dashboards for better decision-making.
